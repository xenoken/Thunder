# Thunder


Thunder is a small extension that improves the typing experience, allowing writers to type text more quickly and efficiently.


## Description

Thunder works by replacing a **tracked** character with a string called **replacer** as soon as the tracked character is typed *twice* in a row.


# Getting Started

Thunder comes with a default Mapping List. For example to type the '"' (double quotes character) it is possible to avoid the SHIFT + 2 key combination and instead pressing twice the '2' character.
Thunder has default mappings for the common punctuation characters used in computer programming.


## Notes

To also allow tracked characters to be typed twice in a row without being replaced (Escaping them), Thunder also requires tracked characters to be typed quickly. the maximum time distance must be smaller than the MaxInterval setting.


## Features

- Forget Key combinations! Just double tap the character you need.

- Mappings are dynamic! Mappings can be changed at any time. No need to reactivate the extension.


## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `thunder.maxInterval` : the maximum temporal distance between two typings of a tracked character to still trigger a replacement.

* `thunder.mappings` : The list of Thunder Mappings. Each Mapping element tells Thunder how to replace tracked characters.



## Glossary

### Mappings

Thunder does a very simple job: replacing characters with other strings as soon as they are typed twice in a row.

To know *which* strings should be replaced and with *which* strings, Thunder rely on the Mappings list.

In the Mappings list are contained Mapping elements.

### Mapping

A mapping element is logically used by Thunder but it is not represented by a concrete class. In fact a Mapping is simply represented by an array[2].

The first element in the array is a character. This character is the *tracked* character. Thunder will always on the lookout for this character. Whenever this character is typed twice, it will be replaced.

The second element in the array is a string as well. This string is called the *replacer* and will be inserted in the text in place of the tracked character.

### Tracked character

Thunder continuously monitors the text added to the current textEditor and executes whenever one of these appear.

### Replacer

Thunder replaces any tracked character with the corresponding replacer string.
